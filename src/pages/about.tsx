    Welcome to my portfolio!


My journey in software development began with a deep curiosity for technology and a desire to solve real-world problems. 
Over the years, I&lsquo;ve honed my skills in
  <strong> React, JavaScript, Tailwind, Typescript, TRPC, HTML, & CSS </strong>
  and I&lsquo;m always excited to take on new challenges.
<br/>
<br/>
Whether it&lsquo;s building robust web applications, optimizing code for efficiency, or collaborating with diverse teams, 
I thrive in dynamic environments where creativity and problem-solving are paramount.

I&lsquo;m committed to continuous learning and growth, and I&lsquo;m excited to share my journey with you through this portfolio.
